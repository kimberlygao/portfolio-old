## Description
As a portfolio, the purpose of my site is to showcase my work and accomplishments in a way that reflects who I am. The site includes a little about me, my professional experience, my past projects, and ways to connect. Beyond the content, the simple and clean design conveys who I am as a person and what I value. The use of animations and hover effects helps make the website interactive and engaging. My target audience is future employers or those who I might work with in a professional setting.

## How to use
* Home page invert: hover on center home page
* Navigation animations: hover on any of the navigation items for transition
* Color on photos: hover on any photo to reveal color from black and white
* Connect externally: click on any icon on the connect page

## External libraries
jQuery
* I chose to use jQuery to simplify JavaScript syntax and help with responsive interactions.
* I used it to write the css changes on the home screen hover interaction.
* It adds more digestable code and easier implemented features to my site.

d3
* I chose this library since it helps with creating custom svgs.
* I used it to create my logo path and circle.
* It adds uniqueness and customization for the identity of my site.

## Iteration
I made minor design changes form my mockups with layout and not much content wise. I added animations as I saw fit while developing that were not planned for in my prototype.

## Major Challenges
My biggest challenges were all spacing issues. The home page was something that I was not familiar with how to produce in terms of layout so there was a lot of trial and error there. Additionally, the card spacing and grid work was challenging to implement for responsiveness.
